# Capstone-Project
In this paper, we will focus on addressing the challenge of customer retention through data analysis and the development of predictive models. We will explore different techniques and approaches, evaluate their effectiveness, and discuss their application in a business context. To overcome these challenges, Big Data tools are used, such as Apache Spark, which has become a popular and trusted choice in the field of large-scale data processing and analysis. Apache Spark is known for its ability to handle large volumes of data and its exceptional processing speed in distributed environments.
# Project Motivation
Many companies have adopted business models based on monthly or annual subscriptions instead of one-time fees. However, this transition has introduced the challenge of retaining customers and avoiding the loss of subscriptions. The ability to predict and detect customer churn before it occurs has become critical for businesses that want to keep their customers paying.
# File Description
- user_dataset.CSV:Data defined and extracted for the machine learning stage in spark format
- user_dataset_definitive.CSV: Copied Data defined and extracted for the machine learning stage in CSV
- mini_sparkify_event_data.json: only 128 MB portion of the original data set (It is not related in this repository but it is in the Udacity workspace)
- Sparkify.ipynb: The main coding file in jupyter notebook format developed in Udacity workspace, where you can identify the step by step of the CRISP methodology applied in this project.
